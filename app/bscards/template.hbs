      <h2>HTML 5 Drag</h2>
      <p>The [Drag Me] div uses HTML5 drag and drop events to cause the "card editor"
        component to display a "drop-point" using
      an absolutely positioned div. This works pretty well.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h2>Cards</h2>
      <p>The idea here would be to drop cards into "rows" and have them initially, split
        but then be re-sizable. Work still needs to be done around this
